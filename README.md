# Garrett - Python Learning Track

## Description

Practice python and other programming with @ckwolff

## What I've Learned So Far (9/7/2019)
* How to use to git to organize projects (still in progress)
..* How to connect a respository directly to a folder
..* How to check to see if files are current using git pull
..* How to commit and push, commit meaning verify that I want these changes, push meaning that it updates the file that is in the repository
..* I also now understand how to use git status to show what files were changed and git diff to show the exact changes made in the file
..* Also remembered to put in the origin (the repository) and the branch name when pushing the file
* Command prompt actions like cd that opens a location, dir that shows all folders/files in that location, and .. that goes backwards to the previous folder
* Python is an interpreted language which means its converted into machine code during runtime
* How to open files and folders in Sublime
* Syntax highlighting is used to indicate the purpose of different parts of programming languages depending on which language is being used. The language can be set in Sublime to ensure the correct syntax highlighting is being used.
